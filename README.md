## Project - Simple RGB Image Processor

This repository contains the project developed at the end of the curricular unit.

### Goal

The main goal of the project is to use C++ to represent and process RGB color images with 8-bits per RGB channel. By developing code for the following classes:

- `prog::Color`: to represent RGB colors;
- `prog::Image`: to represent images where individual pixels are represented by Color; and
- `prog::Script`: to process scripts that contain image manipulation commands.

A starting code was provided with the initial code skeletons, along with support for reading and writing images encoded in the PNG format and test code to validate our work.

### Notes

The lack of commit and participation history is due to Git not being used for the development of the project.
